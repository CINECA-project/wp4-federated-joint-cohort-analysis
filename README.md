# CINECA WP4

The goals of [CINECA project](https://www.cineca-project.eu/) WP4 is to provide a framework for running federated genomics analyses and to implement several example pipelines using that framework. Components developed by WP4 are listed below.

# Describe the trust model for partner sites, and between sites and controlled-access researchers
Corresponds to:
* **Task 4.1** “Privacy/Data Sharing Model”
* **D4.1** “Report on trust model for partner sites, and between sites and controlled-access researchers”, due in December 2019, done

# Develop the technical framework for performing federated analyses
Corresponds to:
* **Task 4.2** “Execution APIs and environments for Federated Analyses”
* **D4.2** “Framework and APIs for executing federated genomics analyses”

# Develop specific federated analysis applications using the framework
This umbrella goal corresponds to:
* **Task 4.3** “Federated Genomic Analyses Algorithm Development”
* **MS4.2** = *MS15* “Demo workflow running on multiple environments”, due in December 2020

## Federated joint cohort variant genotyping
Corresponds to:
* **Subtask 4.3.1** “Federated joint cohort variant genotyping”
* **MS4.3** = **MS16** “Federated joint variant genotyping”, due in December 2020

## Federated analysis of GWAS and sequencing data
Corresponds to:
* **Subtask 4.3.2** “Federated analysis of GWAS and sequencing data”
* **D4.3** “Development and application of optimised polygenic risk scores”, due in December 2022

## Federated genetic analysis of sequencing-based phenotypes
Corresponds to:
* **Subtask 4.3.3** “Federated genetic analysis of sequencing-based phenotypes”
* **Sub-Subtask 4.3.3.1** “Portable analysis pipelines for sequencing-based phenotypes”
* **Sub-Subtask 4.3.3.2** “Federated genetic analysis of thousands of phenotypes”
* **MS4.4** = **MS17** “Robust RNA-seq quantification workflow”, due in December 2021
* **D4.4** “Meta-analysis of splicing and expression QTLs across three cohorts”, due in December 2022

# Other milestones
There are two milestones not linked to any of the tasks above:
* **MS4.1** = **MS14** “Testing feedback to WP1 on data discovery registry”, due in August 2020
* **MS4.5** = **MS18** “First training materials available”, due in December 2022
